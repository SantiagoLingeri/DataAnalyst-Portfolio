# DataAnalyst-Portfolio


## Welcome to my Portfolio Repository.
## Here I Share my Projects as a Data Analyst.

I'm Santiago Lingeri, a Data Analyst and Psychologyst from Argentina. 
I've learned that every company or organization's success is carried out by people's culture and everyday experience. 
I improve everyday in observing, asking, analyzing data and designing solutions in order to bring the best out of teams and companies.

* This project was designed to provide comprehensive insights into Employees' Attrition within an organization.

* The main focus was analyzing and reporting Key Data Metrics to help businesses understand the factors contributing to Employees' Turnover and make informed decisions to mitigate or prevent attrition.

* Data was retrieved from Kaggle Community "IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance" Dataset.

* You can check the Interactive Dashboard in Tableau Public Cloud

### SQL - Employees Data Cleaning

üìå [*See full Project*](https://github.com/SantiagoLingeri/DataAnalyst-Portfolio/blob/e88b1152209220984397d6d83f3a983ffcb827a0/SQL%20-%20EMPLOYEES%20DATA%20CLEANING.sql)

* This **Project** takes a large raw Employees Dataset and applies a **Cleaning Process** with the main goal to get **Data ready** for extensive **analysis**.

* Within the task, I **found inconsistencies** in Data Modeling that could become obstacles in everyday Data Handling.

* To **prevent** this, I desinged and implemented a **solution that simplifies** future **Analytics Processes** , while **preserving the integrity** of the **Database**.

### SQL - Employees Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

üìå [*See full Project*](https://github.com/SantiagoLingeri/DataAnalyst-Portfolio/blob/e88b1152209220984397d6d83f3a983ffcb827a0/SQL%20-%20Employees%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.sql)

* This Project involves conducting an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the [previously cleaned Employees Database](SQL%20-%20Employees%20Data%20Cleaning), in order to **identify patterns** in data and **answer relevant HR questions**. 

* By leveraging **SQL queries**, the Project **aims** to provide valuable **Insights** into the **company's workforce composition**, **gender distribution**, understand **compensation**, **positions**, **departments**, and explore various aspects of the employee dataset.

* Finally, **Insights** and conclutions are summarized with **tables** and **stored procedures** to **automate everyday proccesses** and make **Data Exploration more dynamic** in the future.

* **SQL skills used:** Data Manipulation Language (DML), Select, setting conditions, Joins, Aggregate Functions, Converting Data Types, Subqueries, Creating Views, Stored Routines.

### SQL - Design & Build Business Database

üìå [*See full Project*](https://github.com/SantiagoLingeri/DataAnalyst-Portfolio/blob/e88b1152209220984397d6d83f3a983ffcb827a0/SQL%20-%20Design%20%26%20Build%20Business%20Database.sql)				
                                                    
*	This project involves the **designing** and **creating** a comprehensive **Business Database (DB)** using **SQL**. 

*	The **main goal** was to **efficiently manage** various aspects of a **Business's operations** by **modeling a DB schema** that can efficiently **store and organize business-related data**; such as Sales transactions, Customer information, Item details, and Company records. 

*	In addition, the project aims to ensure **DB's integrity** and **long-term functionality** by **minimizing** data **duplication**, while **optimizing data handling**.

*	The **DB schema** ensures the **relationships** between different entities are **maintained**, allowing for **easy retrieval and analysis of Business information**.

*	The **key steps** of the project included:

		1. Creating DB and 4 tables (sales, customers, items, and companies)
		
		2. Assigning Primary and Foreign Keys: Primary keys ensure the uniqueness of each record in the tables. Foreign keys establish essential relationships between tables, enabling efficient data retrieval.

		3. Setting Constraints: To enforce data integrity and prevent validation errors. These constraints included unique keys, default values, and cascading delete actions to maintain data consistency.

		4. Data Validation: Handling Data types accurately for every feature to avoid future errors.

		5. Data Pre-processing: The database was prepared to handle potential data discrepancies, and improve data quality.

* SQL skills used: Data Definition Language(DDL), Create, Primary Key, Foreing Key, Constraints, Data Types, Relational Database,
