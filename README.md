* This **Project** takes a large raw Employees Dataset and applies a **Cleaning Process** with the main goal to get **Data ready** for extensive **analysis**.

* Within the task, I **found inconsistencies** in Data Modeling that could become obstacles in everyday Data Handling.

* To **prevent** this, I designed and implemented a **solution that simplifies** future **Analytics Processes** , while **preserving the integrity** of the **Database**.

*	This project involves the **designing** and **creating** a comprehensive **Business Database (DB)** using **SQL**. 

*	The **main goal** was to **efficiently manage** various aspects of a **Business's operations** by **modeling a DB schema** that can efficiently **store and organize business-related data**; such as Sales transactions, Customer information, Item details, and Company records. 

*	In addition, the project aims to ensure **DB's integrity** and **long-term functionality** by **minimizing** data **duplication**, while **optimizing data handling**.

*	The **DB schema** ensures the **relationships** between different entities are **maintained**, allowing for **easy retrieval and analysis of Business information**.

*	The **key steps** of the project included:

		1. Creating DB and 4 tables (sales, customers, items, and companies)
		
		2. Assigning Primary and Foreign Keys: Primary keys ensure the uniqueness of each record in the tables. Foreign keys establish essential relationships between tables, enabling efficient data retrieval.

		3. Setting Constraints: To enforce data integrity and prevent validation errors. These constraints included unique keys, default values, and cascading delete actions to maintain data consistency.

		4. Data Validation: Handling Data types accurately for every feature to avoid future errors.

		5. Data Pre-processing: The database was prepared to handle potential data discrepancies, and improve data quality.

* **SQL skills used**: Data Definition Language(DDL), Create, Primary Key, Foreing Key, Constraints, Data Types, Relational Database.

This project presents an overview of a **Hotel's Customers general experience**, including many aspects like Net Promoter Score, Rating by Section, Time of year, Purpose of visit and Source of advertising.

The main focus was to analyze potencial trends, detect strengths and obstacles in giving the best experience to each guest.

![Customer Analytics Dashboard.jpg](https://github.com/SantiagoLingeri/DataAnalyst-Portfolio/blob/6ce3f51455b52f7c0e49b580e2d9185a31d7a78c/Customer%20Analytics%20Dashboard.jpg?raw=true)


**Results of Analysis**

-   Overall rating is satisfactory but not exceptional. Oportunities exist to bring magnificent experiences to customers.
    
-   Net Promoter Score (NPS) is positive, a sign of guest loyalty. Still, there's room to further cultivate customer advocacy and turn more guests into promoters.
    
-   Staff appears as a Hotel's strenght area, receiving the best rating by customers. On the contrary,  Restaurant service was very low-rated.

-   Gender analysis shows there are no significant differences between male and female guest reviews.
    
-   Principal Purposes of visit are Business first, and Vacation second.

- Vacation-oriented guests exhibit preferences for the first half of year, and become more detractors near July-August, and October-Dicember.
    
-   Business-oriented guests, on the other hand, find better experiences in the second semester and their recommendations decrease in January-February and May-June. 
    
-   Business-oriented guests respond better to Email Advertising, while for Vacation-oriented guests, Hotel Booking Sites, Word o mouth, Search engine and Facebook Ads are more effective.
    
-   Business-oriented guests are more likely to notice the hotel through email advertising, while vacation-oriented guests discover it via various channels, including hotel booking sites, word of mouth, search engines, and Facebook ads. 

**Final Recomendations**

 Opportunities exist for enhancing various aspects of the guest experience to achieve higher ratings:

- Implement improvements in Restaurant Area and dining experiences.
- Attend to specific Business or Vacation guest needs, by tailoring services leading to a more personalized and satisfying stay.
- Seasonal adjustments to services and offerings.
- Drive targeted marketing efforts based on guest preferences.

This **Project** is an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python, focusing on HR & Sales.** 
The **main goal** of this analysis is to clean and prepare the data, visualize key trends and patterns, and gain valuable insights by leveraging Python's data manipulation and visualization capabilities.

**Steps Involved:** 

1.  **Data Loading:** Importing the datasets into Python using the Pandas library.
2.  **Data Cleaning:** Identifying and addressing data quality issues, including missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
3.  **Data Visualization:** Creating a variety of visualizations using libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib to explore data distributions, relationships, and trends.
4.  **Outlier Detection:** Identifying and handling outliers to ensure robust analysis.
5.  **Variable Transformation:** Converting data types and addressing spelling errors for consistency.
6.  **Correlation Analysis:** Analyzing correlations between variables using a heatmap.
7.  **Regression Analysis:** Exploring predictive relationships between variables.
8.  **Insight Generation:** Extracting meaningful insights and findings from the analysis.

**Outcome / Insights** 
- Women represent around 60% of Employees.

- General Sentiment is mostly Positive (67%) and Neutral (21%), with 12% of Negative Feedback.

- 97% of Employees give Top Rating to Managers.

- HR Department has the higher number of employees (37%), prior to Production (34%) and Sales (15%). This workforce distribution might need a second review in near future.

- Sales highly increase in Q3 (May, June, July and August)

- Quarter with Targeted Campaings aren't related to significant increase in sales.

- Sales and IT Department carry out the highest Performance Scores, while lowest Performance is observed in Marketing and Research & Development Departments.

- Higher Customer Ratings and Lower Defects Reported should acquire KPI relevance, due to they predict Units Sold across all products. 

- On the contrary, giving Discounts isn't increasing Units sold.

- Engagement in Employees forecasts Higher Performance Score across all Departments.

- Higher Employee Satisfaccion doesn't necesarily leads to improve Performance Scores in general.
