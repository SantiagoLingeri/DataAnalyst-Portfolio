6.  **Insightful Analysis:**
    
    -   Interpret the visualizations to derive meaningful insights from the data.
    -   Identify trends, patterns, and potential areas for improvement in the hotel's customer experience.
    
7.  **User Testing:**

    -   Include any calculations or transformations performed on the dataset.
9.  **Final Presentation:**
    -   Once satisfied with the dashboard's accuracy and usability, present the insights and findings to stakeholders.

### Results of Analysis

-   Overall rating is satisfactory but not exceptional. Oportunities exist to bring magnificent experiences to customers.
    
-   Net Promoter Score (NPS) is positive, a sign of guest loyalty. Still, there's room to further cultivate customer advocacy and turn more guests into promoters.
    
-   Staff appears as a Hotel's strenght area, receiving the best rating by customers. On the contrary,  Restaurant service was very low-rated.

-   Gender analysis shows there are no significant differences between male and female guest reviews.
    
-   Principal Purposes of visit are Business first, and Vacation second.

- Vacation-oriented guests exhibit preferences for the first half of year, and become more detractors near July-August, and October-Dicember.
    
-   Business-oriented guests, on the other hand, find better experiences in the second semester and their recommendations decrease in January-February and May-June. 
    
-   Business-oriented guests respond better to Email Advertising, while for Vacation-oriented guests, Hotel Booking Sites, Word o mouth, Search engine and Facebook Ads are more effective.
    
-   Business-oriented guests are more likely to notice the hotel through email advertising, while vacation-oriented guests discover it via various channels, including hotel booking sites, word of mouth, search engines, and Facebook ads. 

### Final Recomendations

 Opportunities exist for enhancing various aspects of the guest experience to achieve higher ratings:

- Implement improvements in Restaurant Area and dining experiences.
- Attend to specific Business or Vacation guest needs, by tailoring services leading to a more personalized and satisfying stay.
- Seasonal adjustments to services and offerings.
- Drive targeted marketing efforts based on guest preferences.
